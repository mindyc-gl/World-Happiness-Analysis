# World-Happiness-Analysis

Happiness can be considered as a type of psychological experience. That contains a value of both the life quality and the degree of life satisfaction. It manifests as a positive psychological experience based on life satisfaction. The happiness score is the index value to measure the specific degree of life satisfaction. 
 
This project is focused on analyzing what and how variables affect the happiness of people in the world.  Also, to develop a prediction model based on this happiness score. The dataset is from a landmark survey for each country in 2018 by World Happiness Report. That collects the happiness scores from 156 countries with different variables that may affect the scores.
 
The Dataset contains various attributes which may affect the happiness index of the country, but I removed the “rank” column by R code.  Then, this data set contain the following 8 variables:

1)Country or Region: Name of the country or regions in strings
2)Score: Total happiness score in numbers
3)GDP per capita: GDP per capita of the country in numbers
4)Social support: Level of social support given to citizens in numbers
5)Healthy life expectancy: Access to healthcare, and general health level in the country in numbers
6)Freedom: Freedom to make individual life choices in numbers
7)Generosity: How much the country is involved in peacemaking and global aid in numbers
8)Perception of corruption: The level of corruption in the country in numbers
9) Continent: Continent of the country
(I classified each of country into its continent to analysis the happiness index for different continent of people in the world)
